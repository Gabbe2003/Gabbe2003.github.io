                <p>TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft that is a typed superset of JavaScript. It adds optional static typing and other features to JavaScript, making it more robust and scalable for large-scale applications. TypeScript code is transpiled into plain JavaScript code, which can then be executed by any JavaScript runtime.

                    The main goal of TypeScript is to enhance the development experience by providing static types, which allow developers to catch errors and bugs at compile-time rather than at runtime. </p>
